# Canvas Grading Analytics

[Track how close version 1.3 is to completion.](https://github.com/smtech/smcanvas-grading-analytics/tree/release/1.3)

Generate some reporting on faculty grading practices. To start automated data-collection, run the private/data-collection.sh script once. It will harvest the first round of data and then create a crontab job to repeat that process every night at midnight.
